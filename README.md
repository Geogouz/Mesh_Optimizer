"Mesh Optimizer" is an application that can assist with the problem of placing optimally a given set of Radio-Nodes (RNs) in an indoor 2D environment. The term optimal could be subject to different interpretations and definitions and, depending on the goals, there can also be different optimization approaches. Yet, in each case, what we are ultimately interested in adjusting, is the signal Radiomap (according to the respected definition).

In our case, the implemented method aims to find the Node-Setup that offers the maximum overall indoor coverage, after simulating various radio-map scenarios based on an enhanced free-space path loss signal model..

Guide:
=============================================
For its functionality, you can take a look at the following [Guide](https://github.com/Geogouz/Mesh_Optimizer/blob/master/Content/Guide.pdf)

___
Mesh Optimizer has been developed within the frame of a [Thesis project](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A4539b64d-1b05-49d0-9dfe-cacf3ffbfd7c) at Delft University and presented at [ISPRS Conference](https://isprs-archives.copernicus.org/articles/XLII-2-W13/909/2019/).

An executable file is also provided for direct usage: [Download Ver. 1.0.0 Beta](https://github.com/Geogouz/Mesh_Optimizer/blob/master/Content/Mesh Optimizer.png)
